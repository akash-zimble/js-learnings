Google's V8 is world's fastest and powerful JavaScript Engine. It has named V8 based on powerful car Engine v8.

Flow of Execution
-> v8 first generates AST(Abstract Syntax Tree) with its own parser.
-> Then Ignition(interpreter) interprets syntax tree, and generates ByteCode.
-> Then TurboFan(compiler) compiles the bytecode, and generates machine code.
-> This machine code is executed on cpu.

The V8 engineâ€™s Ignition interpreter, coupled with the renowned TurboFan optimizing compiler, allows for the compilation of highly optimized machine codes from bytecodes, 
further improving performance. The V8 engine also have garbage collector named Orinoco, which is designed based on Mark&Sweep algorithm.


Notes: 
An Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is a hierarchical tree-like data structure that represents the syntactic structure of source code in a programming language.
